1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,792
Now I move on to gravity

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:07,936
I showed this Slide the properties of ellipse I just to remind you that we talked about the eccentricity and a major axis

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,728
Let's move on from there

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,008
The Chocolate War about

5
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,032
The properties of the ellipse

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,104
I said the sun is at one Focus Lee leafs

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,872
The closest approach

8
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,152
Call that perihelion

9
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,736
And at maximum distance from the Sun is called aphelion

10
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
And

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
From the centre to the edge is a distance a

12
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,368
From the centre to here

13
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,904
This was called C

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
And was equal to EA

15
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,000
He is a number less than 1

16
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,816
As you combine those you'll find that this

17
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,376
Distance to closest approach we get to

18
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,168
The perihelion distance is

19
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,240
8 * 1 - Erie is a number that's

20
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,288
Less than 1 is between 0 and 1

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,896
And the aphelion distance the maximum distance just using the geometry and straightforward there

22
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,200
Is a * 1 + 8

23
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,808
And you'll note of course I add this distance plus this doesn't mean you're going to be in

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
Tire

25
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:01,696
Major oxide is the semi-major axis a plastic semi-major axis a2a

26
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
So these two digits is always have to add up to

27
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,560
The two eggs that's just the definition of a major Acts

28
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,864
So you can always write this the minimum

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,680
Plus the maximum distance is equals to a sister

30
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,520
Very straightforward identity and might turn out to be useful somewhere

31
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,616
And if you were to look up here and look at this and know this plus this you will find that in fact

32
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:24,480
Does a -80 * 8 + 3 * 8 can select ended up with a plus a witch gives

33
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,528
Can obviously the same thing

34
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
Turns out you Wausau

35
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,928
Newton's equations that show the orbits are an ellipse

36
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
Critical point in this

37
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,840
Is the centre of mass now I'm not going to do the calculations but I have another reason for showing the centre of mass

38
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144
Because the size of the orbits

39
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Depend on

40
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
The masses of the objects

41
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,776
So if you're doing the calculations to

42
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
To work out with the orbits look like

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,384
Rattling doing two separate bodies

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,968
Play a star and a planet in orbit around each other

45
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
And trying to solve two different sets of orbits

46
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,600
It's much more to me to move into a different reference frame

47
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,160
And reference frame that's useful is look

48
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
Center of mass reference frame

49
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,768
Do you have to deal with all the other emotions that these two things might be doing

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,608
And in fact she look at the centre of mass reference frame that is

51
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
The distance from the centre of Mass to the star

52
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,312
Is A1 and this is to this other star or could be a planet a to the sum of the two is the distance between

53
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
In the two stars

54
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,992
It turns out if they're not of equal Mass the centre of mass of course is closer to the more massive thing so here's a free stamp

55
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,320
Michael has a mass 2m has a mass of 1 M and A Center of mass

56
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Is somewhat to the left

57
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
And

58
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
The centre of mass position that's

59
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
Does A1 and A2

60
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Describe it

61
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,768
Is given by this equation M1 A1

62
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
Pecos m-28

63
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
Juices always balance

64
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
M1 is larger a one is smaller

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
So

66
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,800
Dealt with this before sort of I said that we had was Kepler's third law where we had

67
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,104
A relationship between. And

68
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
Semi-major axis. Squared is equal to 7 major axis

69
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,760
Cute but that was a very specific case in fact that's

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
Only really true

71
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,344
That particular version of the equation

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
When you have a very massive object like the sun

73
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
And a very low Mass Ave

74
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Chip like

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
A planet

76
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,792
Because the centre of mass is essentially in the Sun

77
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,888
In the sun more or less looks like it's fixed at the centre of mass

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,288
So it's not really too much ambiguity as to when your measuring from one place to another what we really shouldn't measuring from is the centre of mass

79
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,408
Direct me someplace with other objects for example where there's two stars with one of those not of negative Mass

80
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
This is a form of Kepler's Law that you're going to end up with

81
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,296
Again I'm not driving all this for you I'm just trying to give you a few definition

82
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
So if you have a case where you're dealing with a

83
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,720
A star that is twice the mass of the sun we caught a 2 solar mass star

84
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
Plus another star in orbit around it that saw

85
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
1 solar mass star very similar to our sun

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,424
Then you could write the equation this winning numbers would actually come out you can write in

87
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,240
2 solar masses + 1 solar mass

88
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
Times of. Squared in years

89
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
Because we doing everything in solar masses

90
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,456
And we do this any major axis in astronomical units even though it's another pair of stars out there

91
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
Play write the sum of these distances

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,576
From the centre of mass and the sum of these two chords

93
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,880
Is the separation between the two stars

94
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,440
We actually measure the separation between the two

95
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,744
And this is the version of Kepler's Law you get

96
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,071
I can song this is an astronomical units in this isn't solar masses

97
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,447
This is what you would use it turns out it's just coming pretty from this definition of Center Mass and doing the derivation

98
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
What would the orbits look like

99
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
They're going around the centre of mass

100
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,615
Retrieve them each separately go around the centre of mass

101
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
And

102
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,455
Instead of having to make one go around the other and trying to work up the

103
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
Situations which is very complicated we're making music around some common Center of mass

104
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Here's if they have the

105
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,159
Identical masses you'll find there's two identical

106
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
Orbitz

107
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
Each civista Arthur

108
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
Identical masses and it's just the mass

109
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Determined sayings

110
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
There's a

111
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
Common Focus here

112
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
So each of these objects each of these Stars

113
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
Is an orbit

114
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
In an ellipse

115
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Where

116
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,335
There is a common Focus this comment focus is the centre of mass

117
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
The system

118
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,943
In our solar system Kepler saw was he said

119
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
That the sun was at one Focus

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
He wasn't quite right

121
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,343
Okay the sun was really close to 1/4

122
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
If I have to focus

123
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Inside the

124
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Not the centre of the Sun

125
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
But

126
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
Somewhere inside the side cuz the sun is so massive

127
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
You'll notice that a Time 1

128
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
Stars must be

129
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
On opposite sides

130
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
APA Sentra Mass otherwise what does it mean to be the centre of mass

131
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,079
So that means that the centre of mass here

132
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
Is always equidistant between easy

133
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
Because these two are the same masks

134
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
So when the stars are very far away from the

135
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Focus

136
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:47,391
Is the part of the motion where they're moving slowly and its elliptical orbit then they're both moving slowly

137
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
I'm going to come down here and move

138
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,743
Close to this common Focus the centre of mass

139
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
They're both moving fast

140
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
Tree both stars are moving very fast

141
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
So this is in fact that the orbits would look like if we did the whole mathematical treatments in centre of Mass frame and look at each star separate into the

142
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Calculation

143
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,103
We find it we got something like a seahorse have to do something called reduce Mass make it all work

144
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Sort it all out

145
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
That's straightforward

146
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
So here's a case where you have

147
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,039
I am one here has two in a really massive one

148
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
It doesn't move very much

149
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
It's The more mass of one

150
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
The last mass of one has a much larger orbit

151
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
And they're both the gang moving around this

152
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Common Focus

153
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Center of mass

154
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,655
If you were to have a really large mass as in

155
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
The sun compared to planets

156
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,007
Then here's the Sun and you can see the sun's orbit

157
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,847
Around the centre mass is smaller than Tire motion of the Sun

158
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
Is smaller than the radius of the Sun

159
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
The sun's orbit is entirely within the Sun

160
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,783
Because it's so much more massive than any of the planets

161
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Which we have large planet orbits

162
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
And a very small orbit for the Sun

163
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
There is a centre of mass of the entire solar system

164
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
And

165
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
We're going to calculate all the motions

166
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,399
As orbits around the solar system

167
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Barry

168
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Center

169
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
So there is the Sun

170
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
And that red

171
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Diamond is the

172
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,359
Center of mass of our solar

173
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
Notice the time is moving really fast up here

174
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
So notice that.

175
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,783
Sutter the mass of the solar system was inside the Sun for a few moments

176
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Just a point

177
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Center Mass

178
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
The solar system is primarily defined by the

179
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Sun

180
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
But the next biggest

181
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
Thing that is important

182
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Jupiter

183
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,143
So the main motions you're seeing of the sun are the Sun moving in reflex

184
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
The Jupiter

185
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,543
What emotion is complicated because there's lots of other planets in our solar

186
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,407
Besides being dragged around by all the planets in

187
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
In the solar system is so ends up with his rather complicated

188
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,087
But when you're doing the mathematical derivation

189
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,671
One of the fundamental equations that we use as we use the conservation of energy

190
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:03,327
And that has many other places in this course we're a conservation and she's going to be a third of a critical thing trying to understand what happens in fact

191
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
The entire evolution of

192
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,447
Have our son for exact was an exercise in conservation of energy

193
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:13,055
Entire universe evolves because of problems in the conservation of energy

194
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
The sun is shining

195
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
Shining means it's losing energy

196
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
Something has to change

197
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
Can the Sun cause losing energy to can't do that forever

198
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,343
That the fundamental driving thing for every stars stars shine so they have to change

199
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
Because they have to evolve because they are

200
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,439
Not conserving energy they need a new source of energy

201
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
Keep on Shining

202
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Play energy can never be

203
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Created or destroyed

204
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,143
Energy changes form as it moves between objects you can convert it to Mass

205
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
The total mass energy

206
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
Content combined

207
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
All the universe

208
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
Hasn't changed remains

209
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
The same now it's

210
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Moved around

211
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,175
Kinetic energy is a good starting spot we're trying to talk about motion

212
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,247
Orbit so kinetic energy is the most relevant energy

213
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
1/2 MV squared

214
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,135
You might remember the Newton's law of gravity had the force was

215
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Gravitational constant

216
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
Capital G

217
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
* M1 mass of one object

218
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,791
M to the mass of another object

219
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
Divided by the distance

220
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
Between them

221
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Square

222
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
That's the for slaw

223
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,055
Turns out that the energy that goes with that we called gravitational potential energy

224
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:22,431
At almost the same thing except there's a negative sign in front and it's not r squared it's r

225
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
This is the energy

226
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
But things have in a gravitational field

227
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,599
This is the kinetic energy they have if they're moving

228
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
These two equations combined give you all kinds of

229
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,767
Useful things that you can do about orbits as you will see in a few moments

230
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
Notice that this is negative

231
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
If R is really really big

232
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
1 / R is really really small and this

233
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
Become 0 psi at Infinity very large distances

234
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
The potential energy is zero

235
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
Hazard gets

236
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,015
Smaller and smaller this number becomes bigger and bigger negative it becomes more and more negative

237
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,855
So it's not getting bigger is getting more negative affect getting

238
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Smaller

239
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Soda Springs

240
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
Come close together

241
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,999
That potential energy becomes

242
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Smaller

243
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
Last has less energy

244
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Well

245
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,911
Where does it go energy can't be destroyed

246
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,775
In terms of the interviews were talking about the only energy that we have potential energy and kinetic energy

247
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
The sum of them

248
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
If you add up all the energy

249
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
It's a constant energy doesn't change

250
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
So we can just write it that way

251
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
Potential energy

252
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Which was the you

253
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,575
And the kinetic energy added together is a constant

254
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
If there's no outside forces pushing

255
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,463
What does that mean I just said the potential energy Falls

256
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,023
Decrease is when things come closer together

257
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
That means that kinetic energy must increase

258
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,423
This type of energy plus this type of energy is a constant

259
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,471
And one of them gets smaller

260
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
The other one has to get bigger or us not

261
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
Adding up to a concert

262
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,383
In that case of this motion is gravitational motion of

263
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,711
Objects around the Sun or other kind of orbit

264
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
We know that it's faster at some points in its orbit

265
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,343
Play close to the Sun and its Lord other points

266
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
So the kinetic energy is changing

267
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,719
Where does energy go 1/4 goes into gravitational potential energy

268
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,839
As it was further and further from the Sun we slow down and lose kinetic energy what we gain potential energy

269
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,447
We're moving at the slowest point when we're far from the Sun at this particular instead

270
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,103
When we're at aphelion moving at right angles to the Sun and then the motion isn't quite circular down hearing it

271
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
Closest point at perihelion were also moving

272
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
At right angles to the Sun

273
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,015
But not at all these other points Harris not quite perpendicular

274
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
The other

275
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
Useful conserved quantity

276
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,767
Which comes into doing orbits but going to come into when I start talking about the formation of the solar system information Stars

277
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
This is the

278
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
Limiting principle this is that thing that really

279
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
Governance what we see Willy

280
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,215
Pornstars about this is why we have a solar

281
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
Because of conservation of angular momentum

282
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
That wasn't a conserved quantity

283
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,639
Everything will be spiritually would have nothing flat and we have no flat and disc

284
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
The planets

285
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Things like that

286
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,015
So spin is a conserved quantity conservation of angular momentum

287
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,343
The symbol for angular momentum is a capital l

288
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
Are equals the mass

289
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
Times the speed

290
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
X the distance so

291
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
The momentum depends on

292
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:21,887
The mass of this object the speed it's moving at and the distance away and in fact has the speed perpendicular

293
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
Tua radius that's the ACT

294
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
Allstate that matters

295
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,335
And if there's no outside forces acting on an object this is a conserved quantity it doesn't change

296
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
So that means if

297
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,711
Is Alice a concert if the distance becomes smaller

298
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,295
Is only the mass doesn't change the speed must become greater

299
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,391
So whenever an object that orbits at CineLux for example

300
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
When it moves in closer

301
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,999
The distance is smaller the speed has to be figure that's

302
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
In fact why

303
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,119
The speed is larger when you're at perihelion and aphelion light mention this last day when I

304
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
First Choice shop

305
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
Lots of examples of anger mentum

306
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,799
Both the people who what do flips in the air on skis and I'm boards

307
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
And then also the figure skaters

308
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
If you put your hands out when you're spinning you slow down because

309
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
You're moving more mass out to a larger distance

310
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,551
You bring your hands in and you're spinning you will spin faster

311
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
Because if by making the distance small you make the

312
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Speed large

313
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,487
And so this is a very familiar estimate we've seen many times before

314
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Special Sports things

315
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,935
And I've already said that as you're at smaller dispensation move faster larger Arrow here because of conservation of air

316
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Sacramento

317
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,823
Inaka derivation but I will point out that this is what you would get

318
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,895
If you take Newton's law of gravity

319
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
And the conservation of angular momentum

320
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
And you just

321
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Do the algebra

322
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,807
You got an equation that relates the.

323
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
To the semi-major axis

324
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
This is the one you've already seen

325
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,535
. is related to the semi-major axis. Squared and a major axis

326
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Cute

327
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,399
And the first version the clinic Kepler saw he just said they were related to each other

328
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,215
If you used to write unit solar constant was one

329
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Videos years on the lap

330
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,103
An astronomical units here than it was in a square brackets had a value of 1

331
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
If you have something where the masses are

332
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Very different from the master

333
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
If you got

334
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Two stars for example

335
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
You could just do it in solar masses an astronomical unit

336
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
But if you want to do it in proper

337
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:24,511
Scientific unit seal metres and kilograms and things like that this is the full correct formula

338
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
Gravitational constant for Newton's Law

339
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,399
The mass here in kilograms for two objects and is a 4 pi squared

340
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
Set the full General version

341
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Capitals

342
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Third law

343
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
About if you take

344
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Conservation energy

345
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,663
And gravity and just saw through 4th all the forces involved

346
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,759
There's a force that has to do with keeping things in in circular motion centripetal force

347
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
Not even try to get into the physics of that

348
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,623
If you add in conservation of energy

349
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
That's not part of Kepler's Third Law

350
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Curad and conservation energy

351
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,791
And do lots of lots of math not hard but it is a page of algebra

352
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
You come up with this equation which is essentially

353
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
Equation governing the velocity

354
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
Speed

355
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
This is a velocity

356
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
At any

357
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,335
Point in the orbit it is not the perpendicular Veloster anything like that it's just

358
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Travelocity

359
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Velocity

360
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
With kinetic energy

361
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
And this is an energy equation and essentially

362
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
It's looking at the kinetic energy to

363
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,343
What's a century the potential energy on this side

364
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
That's where it comes from

365
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
Depart of derivation equation

366
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
So this tells you

367
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,351
For a particular size of orbit Asus any major accident tells you how big the orbit is

368
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
The masses are fixed the gravitational constant us fix

369
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
But as you move around in that orbit

370
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,287
You're at different distances from

371
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
The focus

372
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,895
So are here the distance from the centre of mass of the focus of the orbit

373
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
And this is the velocity

374
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
You can compute it anywhere anymore but just know

375
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
Where you are in your bed how far away are you from

376
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
From the focus of the orbiting for the solar system

377
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,743
That's really straightforward is how far you away from the Sun this is the distance from the Sun

378
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
This is the size of the orbit

379
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
And you can

380
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
Calculate the velocity at any point

381
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,679
For the Earth go around the Sun

382
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,263
Are is one astronomical unit AU is one astronomical unit

383
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
So this becomes

384
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
2 /

385
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,127
1 - 1/1 this becomes

386
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
1 / one astronomical unit

387
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
And because it's

388
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
Speed of the Earth around the Sun

389
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
It's pretty much a contest

390
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
Anesthetic conservation equation

391
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,719
Assassin thrown in with Kepler's Law has been driving you come up with us

392
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Conservation

393
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Equation state

394
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,095
So just to summarize three versions of Kepler's Law

395
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
The one that's

396
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
Pretty useful for our solar system

397
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:44,031
If you're going to work a little bit more gentle work in solar masses and distance in AU sand

398
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
Time in years

399
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,871
And here's the most General with the regular

400
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
Scientific unit
